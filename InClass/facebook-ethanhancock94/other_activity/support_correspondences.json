We looked over the photo, and though it doesn't go against one of our specific Community Standards, we understand that it may still be offensive to you and others. No one should have to see posts they consider hateful on Facebook, so we want to help you avoid things like this in the future.From the list above, you can block Jeff Pall directly, or you may be able to unfriend or unfollow them. If you unfollow them, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay friends on Facebook but you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see their posts in your News Feed.We know these options may not apply to every situation, so please let us know if you see something else you think we should take a look at. You may also consider using Facebook to speak out and educate the community around you. Counter-speech in the form of accurate information and alternative viewpoints can help create a safer and more respectful environment.",
