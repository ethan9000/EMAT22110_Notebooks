Believe me, many people agreed with me, they were just smart and humble enough to keep their mouths shut. Now I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say anything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to regret. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m done. You have no idea what was going on in my life at the time, and you certainly have no idea what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on now. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to waste any of my fleeting energy on something that happened months ago.",
