I personally feel like jareds boundaries were overstepped because he told him to not have certain people over and said he heard everyone joking about it the other night and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when it started to get intense.  He said he could hear everything you guys were saying and then heard knocking from one of the people he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be there. So personally that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m upset because jared drew a line about having that girl over and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken seriously, and That he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about how it effected jared and sees that there was nothing wrong. Also I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m unsure why she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to contact him when he has not replied or given any actions to give her reasons to contact him still. I do wanna say it was very nice getting beers with you guys and hanging out so it sucks that even tho it seems like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, he genuinely wants you guys to be apart of everything and like everything to be good and civil.",
